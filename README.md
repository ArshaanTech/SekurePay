# Secure Banking Payment Gateway  

## Overview  
This project enhances the security of banking payment gateways by integrating *facial recognition* and *blockchain encryption*. By leveraging biometric authentication and decentralized security, the system ensures that only authorized users can access and approve transactions while preventing fraud and data breaches.  

## Features  
- *Facial Recognition Scanner* – Verifies user identity through AI-powered facial authentication.  
- *Blockchain Encryption* – Encrypts and stores transaction data securely, preventing unauthorized access.  
- *Multi-Factor Authentication* – Ensures only verified users can process payments.  
- *Tamper-Proof Ledger* – Blockchain technology ensures data integrity and immutability.  

## Methodology  
1. *User Authentication:*  
   - The system scans and verifies the user’s face before allowing access.  
2. *Transaction Verification:*  
   - Once authenticated, transaction details are encrypted and stored securely using blockchain.  
3. *Data Security & Integrity:*  
   - Blockchain’s decentralized nature ensures that transaction data cannot be altered or tampered with.  
4. *Secure Payment Processing:*  
   - Only authenticated and verified transactions are processed, reducing fraud risks.  

## Tech Stack  
- *Programming Languages:* Python, JavaScript  
- *Biometric Authentication:* OpenCV, TensorFlow (for facial recognition)  
- *Blockchain Framework:* Ethereum/Solidity or Hyperledger Fabric  
- *Database:* IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or MongoDB  
- *Frontend:* React.js / HTML-CSS-JavaScript
